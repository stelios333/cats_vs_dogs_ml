# Deep learning cat/dog dog classifier
A CNN-based cat/dog binary classifier trained on the Cats and Dogs Classification Dataset from Kaggle. I've built 2 models:
1. A basic CNN model (train.ipynb): Has an accuracy of around 80%
2. A TinyVGG-based model (train_tinyvgg.ipynb): Has an accuracy of around 92%
